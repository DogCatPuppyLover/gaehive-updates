<h1>Updates</h1>

<h2>July 6, 2024 - Gaehive Deleted</h2>
<p>The Scratch Team has deleted the Gaehive. The specific reason is not known, but Brook suspects that it may be related to a joke thumbnail consensually "cancelling" a studio member. The warning mesesage recieved by Brook also suggests that it may be related to inappropriate topics being discussed in the studio. Further updates will be posted on this website.</p>
<p>Here is the warning message recieved by Brook: "We removed your studio [♥️ LGBTQ+ ♥️ cancelling Charlie!!!!] because it was inappropriate for Scratch. Please keep your content (including studio information and image) friendly and appropriate for all ages, and welcoming to all. Studio themes that involve extreme violence, forms of romantic expression, and/or triggering subjects are too intense for a service used by young children. Please follow the Community Guidelines when using Scratch. Thanks! - Scratch Team"</p>
<p>A blog calling itself "COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER" ("Sting") was created off-site with the express goal of taking down the Gaehive, soon before the studio was deleted. It is possible that they sent a Contact Us message to the Scratch Team asking them to delete the studio, but this is speculation. Nothing about the blog's identity is known.</p>

<h2>July 18, 2022 - Gender Census Announcement Removed</h2>
<p>The ST has removed the announcement about the Gender Census from the description of the Gaehive, for understandable safety reasons.</p>

<h2>July 16, 2022 - Sapphic Society Deleted</h2>
<p>The Sapphic Society has been deleted, with the ST saying that it was inappropriate for Scratch.</p>  
  
<h2>June 27, 2022 - Agender Hangout Deleted</h2>
<p>The Agender Hangout has been deleted due to it having "abortion rights" in the title and description.</p>
